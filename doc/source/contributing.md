How to contribute
==================

You can contribute to make this project better in various ways.


Exploring SAIO
--------------

You can extend the current [benchmarks](https://github.com/parkag/saio_benchmarks) 
to expose cases where SAIO works better than GEQO.


Bug reports
------------

If you encounter any issues with the module, don't hesitate to send a BUG report
to [https://github.com/parkag/saio/issues](https://github.com/parkag/saio/issues).


Extending SAIO code
-------------------

If you see that the developers of SAIO missed something and a part of the
extension could be improved, don't hesitate and create a pull request!

Since SAIO is CPU bounded, one could try to develop a concurrent version of 
the extension to improve the running speed.


Proposing new algorithms of move generating
-------------------------------------------

If you find a great algorithm of moving through the solution space of SAIO,
consult with the developers of SAIO or just implement it and submit a pull request!
