An extension module for PostgreSQL that implements join order search
with Simulated Annealing.

To use it, you will need the PostgreSQL development headers. Compile
and install with:
$ make
$ sudo make install

After that log in to your PostgreSQL server with a superuser account
and issue:
=# LOAD 'saio';

By default all queries will be planned using SAIO, to disable it use:
=# SET saio TO 'false';

You can learn more about SAIO by reading the PGCon2010
presentation. Get it by entering the pgcon2010/ directory and typing
'make'.
