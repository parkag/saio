 * consider ordering the list of trees in merge_trees to keep the
   biggest tree at the beginning, to mimick merge_clump from GEQO more
   closely
 * select the two random nodes a bit smarter
 * do something about setting the initial temperature, cost * 2 is not
   scaled to anything, so might suck (looks like it doesn't, because
   it's scaled by the cost in the acceptable() function)
